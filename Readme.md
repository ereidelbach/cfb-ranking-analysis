# FPI and SP+ Ranking Analysis

## Summary

In Mid-February 2020, the *very* early 2020 Preseason <a href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/id/28708116/2020-preseason-college-football-fpi-breakdown">FPI</a> and <a href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/id/28687236/preseason-sp+-college-football-rankings-alabama-back-no-1">SP+</a> rankings for College Football were released. While preseason polls are a source of consternation and excitement for fans around the country, no where has the former been more true than in the heartland of America.

Fans of the Nebraska Cornhuskers have endured a rollercoaster of emotion over the last twenty years and many have tired of the annual optimism associated with spring football and the inevitable disappointment that follows later that fall.

Perhaps it's not surprising then that faced with an early top 25 ranking for their beloved Huskers after a third straight losing season, Big Red fans aren't having any of it:

But despite the public backlash, there are those who believe the preseason rankings have validity when viewed through the collect lens:

<div class="center">

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">For predictive modeling I would say they hold as much value as the weather forecast. Which is to say it can be useful to people if they accept it is a model and only meant to determine probabilities.<br><br>The problem is if we only care if it actually rained or didnâ€™t yesterday.</p>&mdash; Brandon Vogel (@brandonlvogel) <a href="https://twitter.com/brandonlvogel/status/1229489703289794571?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 17, 2020</a></blockquote>

<!-- second tweet -->
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" data-cards="hidden" data-partner="tweetdeck"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The standard deviation for an FPI ranking was about 17 spots. So, when I see NU at 22, I think of that as a range between 5 and 39.<br><br>That a) feels like it accounts for a lot of small change (injuries, etc.) and, b) is pretty realistic.</p>&mdash; Brandon Vogel (@brandonlvogel) <a href="https://twitter.com/brandonlvogel/status/1229503539564679168?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 17, 2020</a></blockquote>

Personally, I see both sides of the story. As a passionate fan, I freely admit that I'm as prone to outrage as anyone and I too am weary of continued hype heaped upon a program that has done nothing to deserve it after two decades of mediocrity and three consecutive seasons of borderline-awful football. Simulatenously, I work with data for a living and I understand that there are nuances to the interpretation of the models whose outputs were are so quicky to embrace or disparage.

Thus, I'm setting out on a brief data journey of my own.

The Goal: Understand the validity of the SP+/FPI rankings.  
- Are these projections wildly off base?
- Does the standard deviation apply to all rankings equally? In other words, does it do a great job with 1-10 and a poor job with 20-50?
- Can we identify flags amongst teams that buck the ranking trneds?

To tie it back to Brandon's weather analogy, it's not hard to predict what the weather in San Diego or Phoenix is going to be (i.e. the blue-bloods of the football world like Alabama or Clemson are likely always going to be in the top 5). What is difficult is predicting how perennial heart breakers like Nebraska will perform. How does FPI/SP+ perform for those teams.
